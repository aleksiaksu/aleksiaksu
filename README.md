- Hello, I'm Aleksi, also known as Aksu. 
- I have a passion for undertaking projects across various fields.
- With a strong hobby background and studying in IT, I consider myself a power user and possess a deep understanding of the subject.
- I particularly enjoy making different projects, exploring new ideas, testing and developing them.
- While I wouldn't label myself as a "programmer", I have a solid understanding of website development using HTML and CSS, as well as scripting with LUA.
- You can reach me via GitHub.
